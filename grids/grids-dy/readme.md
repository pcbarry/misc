# Drell-Yan grids

- grid1 contains grid points for tables 10001 and 10002 with Q2 > 36.  Valid only for the kinematics covered by those tables.
- If new datasets are added with different kinematics or the Q2 cut is reduced, grids will have to be adjusted or a new grid created.
- grid1 has an accuracy of ~3% for chi2 and contains 38 grid points.
- grid1_dense has an accuracy of ~0.5% for chi2 and contains 58 grid points.
- You can switch between either grid by changing their names.  The grid named 'grid1' will be used.
