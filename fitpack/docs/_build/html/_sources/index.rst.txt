Contribute to the documentation
===============================

The documentation are located at `fitpack/docs`. 
If you want to help improving the documentation
you can do it simple as modifying/adding rst files 
inside the `docs` and the do a pull request. 
You need to have sphinx and the rtd them 
installed in your system 

.. code-block:: shell
   
   pip install -U sphinx
   pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

Once you modify the `docs` type

.. code-block:: shell
   
   cd docs 
   make html
   firefox index.html

You will need to reload the page once you run the `make`
again. Finally add your author ship at the end of rst files 
so that people can blame you :).
